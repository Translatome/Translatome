Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs in the issues part

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

    Your operating system name and version.

    Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.

    Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the Gitlab issues for features. If you want to start working on an issue then please write short message on the issue tracker to prevent duplicate work.

### Write Documentation

We uses Sphinx for the user manual. 

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue

If you are proposing a feature:

    Explain in detail how it would work.

    Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

    Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome


## Pull Request Guidelines

To update the documentation, fix bugs or add new features you need to create a Pull Request . A PR is a change you make to your local copy of the code for us to review and potentially integrate into the code base.

To create a Pull Request you need to do these steps:

    Create a Gitlab account.

    Fork the repository.

    Clone your fork locally.

    Go to the created snakemake folder with cd snakemake.

    Create a new branch with git checkout -b <descriptive_branch_name>.

    Make your changes to the code or documentation.

    Run git add . to add all the changed files to the commit (to see what files will be added you can run git add . --dry-run).

    To commit the added files use git commit. (This will open a command line editor to write a commit message. These should have a descriptive 80 line header, followed by an empty line, and then a description of what you did and why. To use your command line text editor of choice use (for example) export GIT_EDITOR=vim before running git commit).

    Now you can push your changes to your Github copy of Snakemake by running git push origin <descriptive_branch_name>.

    If you now go to the webpage for your Github copy of Snakemake you should see a link in the sidebar called “Create Pull Request”.

    Now you need to choose your PR from the menu and click the “Create pull request” button. Be sure to change the pull request target branch to <descriptive_branch_name>!

If you want to create more pull requests, first run git checkout main and then start at step 5. with a new branch name.
